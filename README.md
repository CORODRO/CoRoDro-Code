# CoRoDro -- Code
Hello! We are the CoRoDro team! We partecipate at the IGLUNA FC during 2021. 
If you fancy knowing more about our tests check this out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWYhED8Z17Y.

## Motivation
After the IGLUNA Field Campaign of 2021, we decided to make the stable code of our repository public and accessible to anyone. 
We hope that this can help other developers push forward autonomous navigation and operations. 

If you use the code in this repository for your work, ke kindly as you to cite:
```
